#Machine Learning Projects: -

  1. #Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction:- Build a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company     because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.
  2. #Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset:- Build a model to which is capable of analysing and predicting whether as person has heart disease or not.
  3. #Churn Modelling using Simple ANN Model: - Build a very simple ANN model to predict the behaviour of customers which will help to retain them.
  4. #Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Payment Accuracy Bot:- SNAP provides nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food and move towards self-sufficiency.Developed a bot that would help to predict the benefit amount for SNAP program and identify any 
anomalies in the US health care system.  
5. #Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Payment Accuracy Bot:- TANF provides financial assistance to help pay for food, shelter, utilities, and expenses other than medical.Developed a bot that would help to predict the payment amount for TANF program and identify any
